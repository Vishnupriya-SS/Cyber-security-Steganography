# Cyber-security-Steganography
LSB steganography is a technique for hiding images in text by embedding the image's data into least
significant bits(LSBs) of the text. This means that each character in the text is represeneted by a 
series of bits, and the least significant bit of each character is replaced with a corresponding bit 
from the image data.
